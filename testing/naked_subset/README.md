# Tests for unique rectangle pattern recognition

Examples from here: https://www.learn-sudoku.com/naked-triplets.html.

Check by using the GUI.
Load one of the examples and perform basic reduction until no further candidates can be erased.
Then ask for a hint, it should hopefully show the naked subset (potentially after a few other hints)...

Results (as of 06/09/2024):
`example_naked_subset.txt`: succes
`example_naked_subset_2.txt`: success (note: the easiest is to modify candidates manually in interactive mode)
