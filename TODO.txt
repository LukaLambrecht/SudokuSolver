KNOWN ISSUES OR FORESEEN IMPROVEMENTS
- The algorithm for block-block interaction is perhaps not the most general one if self.size > 9.
- The following algorithms were not yet implemented: unique rectangle.
  However, the combination of the current algorithms is already very powerful.
- Support for 4x4, 16x16, etc. grids is in principle included in the code but has not been checked yet. Also, this is not supported in the GUI yet.
- Check imports and GUI behaviour on different platforms and python versions.
- Fix stuck state when trying to solve invalid sudoku (e.g. after pressing 'solve' to soon).
  -> not actually stuck, finishes after a long time, but window is unresponsive during solving
- Find way to display solving log synchronously (related to above)
- Detect when sudoku is solved when in interactive mode.
