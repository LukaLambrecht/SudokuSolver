# Tests for XY-wing pattern recognition

Examples from here: https://www.learn-sudoku.com/xy-wing.html.

Check by using the GUI.
Load one of the examples and perform basic reduction until no further candidates can be erased.
Then ask for a hint, it should hopefully show the XY-wing pattern (potentially after a few other hints)...

Results (as of 06/09/2024):
