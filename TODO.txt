KNOWN ISSUES OR FORESEEN IMPROVEMENTS
- The algorithm for block-block interaction is perhaps not the most general one if self.size > 9.
- The following algorithms were not yet implemented: XY-wing, unique rectangle.
  However, the combination of the current algorithms is already very, very powerful.
- The content of the log file should be integrated in the GUI one way or another.
  At this point only very minimal information is printed to the message box in the GUI.
- Currently only one saved grid is supported which is automatially overwritten if the 'Save' button is clicked.
  This could be generalized using a dedicated save and load window.
- Need to implement more checks on input when using GUI.
- Support for 4x4, 16x16, etc. grids is in principle included in the code but has not been checked yet.
  Also, this is not supported in the GUI yet.
