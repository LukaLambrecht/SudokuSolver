# Tests for unique rectangle pattern recognition

Examples from here: https://www.learn-sudoku.com/unique-rectangle.html.

Check by using the GUI.
Load one of the examples and perform basic reduction until no further candidates can be erased.
Then ask for a hint, it should hopefully show the unique rectangle pattern (potentially after a few other hints)...
