KNOWN ISSUES OR FORESEEN IMPROVEMENTS
- The algorithm for block-block interaction is perhaps not the most general one if self.size > 9.
- The following algorithms were not yet implemented: XY-wing, unique rectangle.
  However, the combination of the current algorithms is already very, very powerful.
- Support for 4x4, 16x16, etc. grids is in principle included in the code but has not been checked yet.
  Also, this is not supported in the GUI yet.
