KNOWN ISSUES OR FORESEEN IMPROVEMENTS
- The algorithm for block-block interaction is perhaps not the most general one if self.size > 9.
- The following algorithms were not yet implemented: unique rectangle.
  However, the combination of the current algorithms is already very powerful.
- Support for 4x4, 16x16, etc. grids is in principle included in the code but has not been checked yet. Also, this is not supported in the GUI yet.
- Check imports and GUI behaviour on different platforms and python versions.
- Implement abort button when solving is taking too long (e.g. when pressing solve to soon)
  (currently the Close button works in this situation, but it would be nice to stay in gui instead of closing it and continue working on the same sudoku)
